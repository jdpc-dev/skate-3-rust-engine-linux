# Authored props and grime follow-up

## Targeted decal correction after layer test

The user rechecked the comparison and identified decals as the unwanted layer.
Repeating grime is unchanged. Wear/stain decals now use 35% of their texture's
alpha; source UVs, dimensions, texture RGB and placement are retained. This is
explicit visual tuning based on the user's feedback, not proof of the original
game's intended opacity and not a recovered native shader constant.

Classification uses the material's authored `decal` texture label for grime,
grunge, stain, oil-dirt, drainage and ground-decal entries. Arrows, logos,
scratches and ramp edge paint retain full authored opacity. A regression test
covers this separation. This is not a blanket fade on every decal material.

Clamped decals also now receive a mip chain, independently of lightmaps, which
remain bilinear mip zero. Previously the shared clamp texture role omitted mips
for both, leaving fine decal alpha detail unfiltered at distance. The new decal
role retains clamp addressing while permitting mip filtering. No map re-export
or owned texture modification is needed. GPU visual verification remains for
the user; source and shader checks cannot confirm the preferred visual strength.

## Grime investigation after user retest

The UV-scale correction did not resolve the user's reported visual mismatch.
The current runtime log confirms the pictured Super Ultra Mega Park area is in
the University package. The separately named MegaPark district inspected earlier
contains different stadium geometry; it is not the correct visual test location.

The actual University's MPboards/MPCutStn materials contain both repeating macro
weathering and separate grime-puddle, long-grunge, water-stain and building-stain
decals. Binary material channel GUIDs agree with the exported bindings. Fifteen
sampled ramp/wood meshes in the current private University package match their
source cache positions, base UVs and independent decal UVs exactly after the
writer's V flip. This rules out a missing decal UV channel in those samples; it
does not establish visual parity or prove which layer causes the reported marks.

An opt-in `SKATE_WEATHERING_COMPARE=1` diagnostic enables F8 to cycle authored
layers, repeating grime off, decals off, and both off. The window title and log
identify the selected mode. The comparison launcher fixes exposure at 2.5 so
automatic brightness adaptation cannot counteract each layer change. Normal
launches retain their original rendering. Material uniforms change only on a
keypress; the original texture flags remain intact for restoration.

This is an isolation tool, not another claimed grime fix. The remaining
strength/scale mismatch needs a user-run layer comparison and ideally a matching
original-game view. No arbitrary opacity or UV scale change was applied.

## Hair rollback

Removed the hair-specific changes from 96adff5 at the user's request: coverage
texture bindings/blending, depth coverage, exported secondary UVs, FLOAT2 vendor
decoder correction and its test. The private character package was regenerated
with the previous exporter. Character probe smoothing remains. The other
worktree's hair implementation was not touched or imported.

## Grime coordinates

The map writer flips both texture rows and base UV V. The world shader formerly
sampled macro/detail maps at `flippedUV * scale`. For a scale of 0.3 this gives
`0.3 - 0.3*v`, but the matching texture-row coordinate is `1 - 0.3*v`: a 0.7
texture-period displacement. MegaPark's authored macro scale is approximately
0.3. This shifts stains onto different parts of the ramps and over decal paint.

Macro and detail UVs now scale in the original coordinate system, then flip V.
The authored opacity and native-reference overlay equation are unchanged:
`saturate((macro.rgb - 0.5) * opacity + 0.5)`, multiplied over the linear
diffuse/decal composite. Reference: scene.hlsl in native renderer commit
f6e0ae87fdfecbadb5c1e36c55d66a744187a3cd. No arbitrary global grime reduction
was introduced. Perceived strength still requires an in-game comparison after
the coordinate correction; adaptive exposure also changes overall brightness.

## Dynamic-object initial placement

Observed source: district Sim RX2 `0xEB001D` records have a 32-byte header,
128-byte records, row-vector affine matrix at +0, world bounds at +64,
instance/locator IDs at +96/+104, template ID at +112 and name offset at +124.
Native TU3 `0x825876D0` (community symbol SimManager::SpawnStatic) loads the
translation at +48 and template ID at +112 before the DMO model lookup.
Mapped image SHA256:
F4AA113EB541BFBA03DBC108CF5AB43F58C965B20FA3B82F9C40938A0AD841C4.

`worlddmo.big` supplies reusable templates. Their EB000D 160-byte tInstance
records bind template IDs to EB0001 model sections. Model mesh tables reference
EB0023 sections, which reference the vertex declarations. The exporter follows
those indices, never mesh order or material display names. Material texture
GUIDs come from the binary channel bindings: the DMO texture namespace's high
bit is absent from display-name suffixes, so suffix matching loses textures.

The exporter composes model, template and locator matrices in row-vector order;
normals use the inverse transpose. Reflections reverse triangle winding. It
neither snaps objects to terrain nor changes their authored matrices. Structured
JSON alongside each presentation package retains IDs, matrices, source hashes,
offsets and unresolved locators for a future dynamic runtime.

Offline restored placements:

| Map | Placed | Unresolved |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| University | 479 | 0 |
| DownTown | 786 | 14 |
| Industrial | 162 | 18 |
| BlackBoxPark | 12 | 0 |
| MaloofMoneyCup | 31 | 0 |
| Remaining five maps | 0 | 0 |

All University placements resolve. 478 of 479 transformed render bounds agree
with their authored locator bounds within 5 cm (most within millimetres). One
open dumpster differs by about 14.5 cm; its authored matrix is retained, since
render bounds and assembly/animated bounds need not coincide.

The 32 unresolved Downtown/Industrial locators reference six template IDs absent
from the supplied DMO catalog. The named assets are also absent from parkassets
by those IDs, and district presentation template tables do not define them.
They remain explicit unresolved records; no substitute geometry is invented.

Runtime loads private/native-props presentation supplements alongside the
existing backdrop packages. This restores visible initial placement only:
objects are not yet pushable, droppable or collidable. Authored
`dynamicobject.*` materials now run through the retail world shader's general
branch (family 0), which lights them with diffuse/normal and the fixed authored
sun direction. This is a host lighting choice, not a recovered native
dynamicobject shader; the previous PBR fallback was left with almost no
directional energy on retail maps and read as unlit. No static district
collision, gameplay or animation logic was changed.

A separate host feature, the Object Dropper, can now instantiate authored DMO
templates and add static contact geometry for them. It does not make the
authored native-props supplement movable, and it does not change the initial
placement path above. See [object-dropper.md](object-dropper.md).

Validation: synthetic record, rotation/scale/normal and invalid-reference tests;
original-data template resolution and placement-bound comparison; offline map
readers and shader composition. Game/recomp was not launched. GPU execution,
appearance, performance and gameplay interaction are not validated here.
